***
This repository contains the script necessary to extract the UCI HAR dataset, convert it into tidy data, and save is as a .csv file.

## Usage

1. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip the file UCI HAR Dataset into a folder named **UCI HAR Dataset** in your R working directory.
3. Open and source the **run_analysis.r** script to create the dataset.

## What the Script Does

1. Combine the testing, training, subject, and activity datasets.
2. Apply and clean up variable names.
3. Extract only data relevant to mean and standard deviation of each measurement.
4. Clean up the workspace.
5. Create a second, separate dataset, containing the means of each measurement for each subject and activity.
6. Write each dataset to a .csv file, "UCI_HAR_Data.csv", and "UCI_HAR_Tidy.csv".
